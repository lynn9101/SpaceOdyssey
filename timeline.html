              <p>The idea of space and humanity’s ventures into exploring the world outside of Earth began hundreds of years ago, predating to the 16th century when an Italian astronomer and physicist, Galileo Galilei, observes the night sky through a telescopic lens. From then, a spark was lit with humanity investing extensive efforts and research into the wonders and mysteries of outer space. </p>
